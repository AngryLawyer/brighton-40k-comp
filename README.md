Brighton 40K Comp
=================

So how does this whole comping thing works?

Idea behind the project is that we want to create more varied 40k events, where less obvious units can be taken with lists and you can still remain competitive, whilst reducing "list spamming" which basically ends up with most armies having similar lists.

You start with 40 points. You deduct points for each choice as per comp list and your final value is the soft score for your army that will be added to your tournament points at the end of event, also that soft score will be used for first round pairings.

You are not allowed to go below 0 points, so if your army selection takes you there, you will have to modify your army.
